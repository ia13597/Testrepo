# **Objectives:**
# 1. List popular languages in Data Science
# 2. List commonly used libraries in Data Science
# 3. Evaluate basic arithmetic expressions

# ### Some of the popular languages that Data Scientists use are:
# 1. Python
# 2. C++
# 3. Julia
# 4. Java

# #### Some of the commonly used libraries used by Data Scientists include:
# 1. TensorFlow
# 2. Matplotlib
# 3. Keras
# 4. Pandas

# | Data Science Tools |
# | ------------------ |
# | Apache Spark |
# | Julia |
# | Tableau |
# | Apache Hadoop |

# ### Below are a few examples of evaluating arithmetic expressions in Python:

# In[1]:


# This a simple arithmetic expression to mutiply then add integers: 
(3*4)+5


# In[2]:


# This will convert 200 minutes to hours by diving by 60:
Hours = 200
Mins = 60
NewHours = Hours/Mins
print("NewHours is: ", NewHours)
